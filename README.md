        “ Cleanliness is next to god and clean cities are as heaven” 
        
The proverb “ Cleanliness is next to god and clean cities are as heaven” is a proverb 
that we are listening from our childhood but do we admire that? NO. So to keep the 
environment clean, we are going to design “CONTACTLESS SMART DUSTBIN”.
        First is the traditional method or the normal use of Dustbins in our daily life. Every 
person in the world disposes of the waste in the dustbin and if the dustbin becomes full, 
he empties the waste inside the bin and again uses the same dustbin. This is the basic use 
of a normal dustbin where no components are used, no coding is done and where 
everything is manual i.e. everything is done by hand. No batteries and no electronic 
components such as Arduino, or NODEMCU are used. The only way of disposal is open 
the lid of the dustbin and dispose of the waste in it, and clean or empty it when it 
becomes full. When the same thing is applied in a neighborhood or a colony, the waste 
becomes more to dispose of, and if the dustbin is full people start throwing the waste 
around the dustbin which leads to different diseases. The official who should empty the 
bin will be irregular in emptying the bin and the waste will be lying in that street for 
weeks causing an unhealthy environment and leading to various diseases.
        The main aim of the project is to design a smart dustbin that is going to help us to keep 
our environment clean and healthy. Smart dustbins will lead us to hygienic life. While 
throwing trash in social areas such as parks, temples, and other crowded areas there will 
be no need of touching the lid of the trash bin as it will open automatically. So the spread 
of viruses through trash bins will reduce. We are inspired by Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
