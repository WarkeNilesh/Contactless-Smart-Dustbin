# SMART DUSTBIN

        “ Cleanliness is next to god and clean cities are as heaven”

The main aim of the project is to design a smart dustbin that is going to help us to keep 
our environment clean and healthy. Smart dustbins will lead us to hygienic life. While 
throwing trash in social areas such as parks, temples, and other crowded areas there will 
be no need of touching the lid of the trash bin as it will open automatically also inform the garbage collector when need to empty. So the spread 
of viruses through trash bins will reduce. We are inspired by Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
